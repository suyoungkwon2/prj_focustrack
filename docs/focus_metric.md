- Focus Score: 집중력 점수
- Scoring time frame: every 30mins

<Formula>
Focus Score=100×(((log(1+1800))/(log(1+CFD)))×0.5 + ((1+WLR)/WLR)×0.3 − (SF/5)×0.1 − (DS/3) ×0.1)

<Variable Explanation>
    1. Switch Frequency (SF)
        - Measures how often users switch between categories.
        - Frequent category switches indicate lower focus.
        - Example: More than 5 switches within 10 minutes = high switch frequency.
        - Impact on FS: Higher SF = Lower Focus Score
    2. Continuous Focus Duration (CFD)
        - Measures the average uninterrupted time spent in 'Growth' category before switching to another category.
        - Longer durations indicate better focus.
        - Example: Spending 25+ minutes in one category = high focus.
        - Impact on FS: Higher CFD = Higher Focus Score
    3. Work-to-Leisure Ratio (WLR)
        - The proportion of time spent on 'Growth' category compared to 'Entertainment' category.
        - A higher ratio means better focus.
        - Example: 75% of total browsing time in 'Growth' category = high focus.
        - Impact on FS: Higher WLR = Higher Focus Score
     4. Distraction Score (DS)
        - Measures how often users transition from 'Growth' directly to 'Entertainment & Daily Life' category.
        - Frequent transitions indicate more distractions.
        - Example: Switching from an online lecture to YouTube frequently = high distraction.
        - Impact on FS: Higher DS = Lower Focus Score
