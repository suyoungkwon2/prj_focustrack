- Focus Score: 집중력 점수
- Scoring time frame: every 30mins

<Formula>
Focus Score=100×(((log(1+1800))/(log(1+CFD)))×0.5 + ((1+WLR)/WLR)×0.3 − (SF/5)×0.1 − (DS/3) ×0.1)

<Variable Explanation>
    1. Switch Frequency (SF)
        - Measures how often users switch between categories.
        - Frequent category switches indicate lower focus.
        - Example: More than 1 switches within 15 minutes = high switch frequency.
        - Targeting min concentration of 15 mins
        - Impact on FS: Higher SF = Lower Focus Score

    2. Continuous Focus Duration (CFD) 
        - Measures the average uninterrupted time spent in 'Growth' category before switching to another category.
        - Longer durations indicate better focus.
        - Example: Spending 50+ minutes in one category = high focus.
           > based on Podomoro & other research: 40~50mins considered "focused"
        - Impact on FS: Higher CFD = Higher Focus Score

    3. Work-to-Leisure Ratio (WLR)
        - The proportion of time spent on 'Growth' category compared to 'Entertainment' category.
        - A higher ratio means better focus.
        - Example: 5 to 1 ratio for Growth to Entertainment+Daily Life = high focus.
        - Impact on FS: Higher WLR = Higher Focus Score

     4. (Drop) Distraction Score (DS)
        - Measures how often users transition from 'Growth' directly to 'Entertainment & Daily Life' category.
        - Frequent transitions indicate more distractions.
        - Example: Switching from an online lecture to YouTube frequently = high distraction.
        - Impact on FS: Higher DS = Lower Focus Score
